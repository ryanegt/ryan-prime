Credit: Ryan Rodd\n\nSome Perspective\nCave rescues are harrowing tales and I've had the privilege to hear a great many, both thrilling and tragic. Last year, I made the (excellent) decision to take a cave rescue seminar held by the National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC) and the NSS. To date the NCRC provides one of the few regulated caving-related training programs in the World.\n\nMy goal was to enrich my own experience and in doing so, be safer about introducing my friends to this sporting hobby. Though inaccessible and sometimes dangerous, caves are some of the most fascinating places on Earth, with environments and features that only a small fraction of people get to experience before they die.\n\nPerhaps one of the most inaccessible of these places is the labyrinth of passages that makes up the bottom section of Ellison's cave. Ellison's cave is notably one of the deepest caves in the world and features the deepest unobstructed pits in the United States. If I had to make a list of places to not be stranded or injured, a cave like Ellisons would be very near the top, maybe outranked by outer space or the inside of a volcano.\n\nMore on Ellisons: 2011 Trip Report | 2012 Trip Report"}], "metadata": {"path": "blog/2018-07-10_ellisons.json", "source": "blog", "date": "2018-07-10", "id": "ellisons-part-1", "title": "Rescue from Ellisons, A Major Account from a Minor Contributor — Part 1", "topic": "cave rescue; background; personal perspective; risk; environment", "topics": null, "tone": ["narrative", "introspective", "informative"], "channel": "internal"}}

Ready to hear to some crazy new idea, or be invited on an impromptu caving adventure, I listened groggily. The information I was able to digest was sparse but all I needed to fly out of bed: ongoing cave rescue… Ellisons… Bottom rescue… all hands on deck. In 15 minutes my gear was packed (cue applause) and I'm jumping into Will's SUV. The drive from Atlanta to Lafayette will take just under 2 hours. I grab some of my NCRC material to start catching up (as if).\n\n\nFantastic Pit in Ellisons is a 586′ free fall\n\nThe Scenario\nThe 2 hour drive is enough to build a giant dossier of speculation about what to expect from the rescue scene. Will had been caving in TAG with Andy Zellner and Kyle Gochenour the previous day and was aware that the initial call for rescue actually went out around 8pm the night before. That means 12 hours had already passed before we got the second call for more rescuers. This time, the call came from Brad Tipton, captain of Hamilton Co. cave rescue who was flying all the way back from Colorado to assist.\n\nBeing a holiday weekend, many local cavers and rescue team members were out of town. Combined with the fact that many other cavers may be unwilling to negotiate a cave as difficult as Ellisons, we concluded that resources for the rescue could be strained.\n\nThe information we had on the patient was that he suffered a compound fracture of the leg and when we departed Atlanta, was still with rescuers at the bottom of the cave. This meant in the worst case he is still at the initial site of the incident, or in the best case ready to be hoisted up Fantastic pit. Considering the severity of the cave in between, the variability between those two scenarios was immense."}], "metadata": {"path": "blog/2018-07-10_ellisons.json", "source": "blog", "date": "2018-07-10", "id": "ellisons-part-2", "title": "Rescue from Ellisons, A Major Account from a Minor Contributor — Part 2", "topic": "emergency call; uncertainty; preparation; scenario planning", "topics": null, "tone": ["narrative", "anticipatory"], "channel": "internal"}}

Incident command was set up at the blue hole surrounded by the fully deployed vehicle and rescue equipment strength of Hamilton Rescue and other TAG agencies. Cave rescue vets including Allen Padgett, Buddy Lane and Patricia Springer had a complete rundown and tasks ready for us. More than 90 rescuers had already shown up and the patient was remarkably already being brought up Fantastic pit by an incredibly elaborate haul system (we learned later: comprised of a counter-balance and flying rebelay). Brad mentioned afterwards that this was a system Hamilton Co rescue had been practicing only weeks before.\n\nThe patient at the time was alive, but declining as he had suffered a head injury during his fall and there was postural indication of brain swelling. The leg injury turned out to be a compound fracture of the femur accompanied by substantial blood loss. Amazingly, three pints of blood had been delivered via life flight helicopter early in the morning and brought to and administered to the patient by paramedics deep in the cave.\n\nThe exhausting hike up to the cave entrance usually takes an hour and involves lugging a lot of heavy gear uphill. At noon, with orders in hand, we shuttle quickly via 4WD gator from the blue hole to the mouth of the cave and entrance control. At entrance control we learned over the comms that the patient has cleared the top of Fantastic pit and the litter is being moved to the bottom of the Warm Up pit and thus the mouth of the cave. For rescue out of such a technical cave, this progress was astounding.\n\n\nUnreeling communication wire into the cave during a mock rescue. Credit: Ryan Rodd\n\nAt the entrance of the cave we met Andy Zellner who emerged having just spent 12 hours underground. Living nearby, Andy was the first on the scene and the very first responder to reach the patient once the 911 call went out. He sat with us for a bit and described the incident scene.\n\nAt the time Dwight (the patient) and friends were executing a cross-over or through-trip in Ellisons. This involves rappelling into one side of the cave, travelling the entire bottom portion and climbing out the other side. When Dwight slipped, he was negotiating a handline assisted climb down (most cavers know this kind of sketchiness) in the bottom passages. Dwight fell, rolled and fell again, out of sight a total of 40-50 feet. He was immediately unresponsive according to the friends that were accompanying him. Little did they know at the time, Dwight had fallen not into a tight crack, but into a lower and wider section of main passage full of rock shale and breakdown. After calling down to him, one friend raced to the surface while the other two stayed behind to find Dwight and attempt first aid. Andy mentioned that when he arrived to the incident scene, the friends had found the patient and were administering first aid that likely saved his life."}], "metadata": {"path": "blog/2018-07-10_ellisons.json", "source": "blog", "date": "2018-07-10", "id": "ellisons-part-3", "title": "Rescue from Ellisons, A Major Account from a Minor Contributor — Part 3", "topic": "incident command; rescue logistics; accident description; first response", "topics": null, "tone": ["narrative", "technical", "respectful"], "channel": "internal"}}

The rescue ongoing 12 hours before we even arrived had made astounding progress and contained therein are stories far more interesting and harrowing than my own. As Andy finished his tales and got a ride down to incident command for some well deserved rest, we heard over comms that the patient had been hauled up the last pit (Warm Up) and was being attended by a physician, CHCRS Team Doctor David Wharton, MD.\n\nThe last stretch of cave, 300 yards of easy stream passage were all that separated the hearsay from experience. It became clear that Will, Marty Abercrombie and I were needed as the surface team to the haul litter and patient out of the cave and up the hill to an awaiting police SUV.\n\nFor a second this seemed unfair, 80 people inside Ellisons worked 14 hours for this moment… pulling this injured soul from the dark, inaccessible confines of the Earth and into the free and open world. We just show up and that gets to be our job. Knowing the litter was making its final move, Will stationed at the mouth of the cave peering into the dark passage, entrance control and incident command at the ready. A few tense moments pass when we hear the rescue crew. Entrance control heralds verbal confirmation, then Will sees their headlamps. Entrance control radios visual confirmation.\n\n\nPassing a patient through a constriction during a mock rescue. Credit: Ryan Rodd\n\nAs the litter approaches and then gets passed to us through the constricted cave opening, I feel the familiar handle of a ferno. Contained within the ferno is standard packaging; vapor barrier, blankets, one inch tubular webbing, cervical brace, stethoscope & blood pressure cuff, and the patient. As my eyes cross over the patient's face, I took a sudden breath and held it. Before me was the face of an unconscious, middle aged man, eyes shut, both black and swollen, head slightly to the side, face bloodied and lacerated.\n\nIn a moment of clarity, it finally hit me that this wasn't an exercise, not another mock-rescue, not the smiling face of a friend pretending to be a rescue patient, but the real thing. Dwight was laying on the stretcher in front of me, his status declining, having been injured and extracted from one of the world's deepest caves. Suddenly there was no sense of pride, fairness or victory, just the overwhelming need to complete the task at hand: to get Dwight out of the cave and up the hill through the brush and into the awaiting SUV as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Cleanup\nThe directive was clear and quickly executed. Once the patient was loaded up and driven off, Will, Marty and I head back down to the cave entrance for bitter work. As exhausted rescuers begin to flow out, there is still the job of reclaiming over 1000 lbs of ropes and rescue gear from the depths of the cave, rolling up comm wire and erasing our tracks.\n\nThankfully crews at the top and bottom of Fantastic pit (deeper into the cave) were already derigging and packing while the remnant rescuers made their own long climbs out. Will, Micha Lane and I were stationed at the top of warm up to help haul gear (and applaud emerging rescuers) for a few hours until the call for deeper assistance came through.\n\nWhen it did, after quickly putting on our vertical gear, we rappel down Warm-Up pit to make our way to the attic (top of Fantastic pit). Its clear we won't be needed any further into the cave, however multiple ropes, rescue gear and a fully packed SKED still need to make their way out. Along with the other rescuers we form an impromptu bucket brigade… the heaviest gear being passed between obstacles and down the small nuisance (elevator) drop for an expedited trip to the Warm Up pit haul points.\n\nThe Exit\n\nAttending the patient in the cave during an NCRC mock rescue. Credit: Ryan Rodd\n\nIn a short hour, rescuers and gear are stationed at the bottom of warm-up. The deepest and most dangerous parts of the cave now quiet, abnegated to peaceful darkness. Two ropes are dropped into the 125 ft, dark, misty pit for hauling gear and making the last climb to the upper passage, but with 30 of us still at the bottom, its clear another rope would be useful.\n\nWill and I decide to wait our turns to climb, allowing the more weary and spent rescuers first access to the surface. Pulling out his camp stove, Will begins to make warm coffee for rescuers at the bottom of the dark pit. Its accepted by a few welcoming hands while passing around trail mix and regaling ourselves with the tales of the day passed.\n\nFinally its time for the last few climbers out of the pit. At the top of Warm Up we meet team rescue captain Brad Tipton, fresh off a plane from Colorado who is astounded by the speed of the rescue team and swearing he thought the operation would take many more hours. The remaining rescuers make the trek down the final passage of the cave, while I pack my vertical gear away and talk to Brad. He reports that after being airlifted to Erlanger hospital in Chattanooga, doctors believe Dwight will survive and recover from the incident.\n\nA slow, final and fulfilling walk later we emerge from Ellison's with entrance control declaring last-out at 6:48pm. With the high sun beginning to set, and a quick thought to my week ahead, I can't help but think how amazing and lucky my first rescue experience has been (even though I probably didn't need to be there).\n\nWhat remains with me now is how fortunate I am to know these people, fellow cavers who at beckoned call plunge 1000 feet into danger and darkness to save a stricken soul. With training and experience I hope I'll never find myself needing to be rescued – but if I do I pray to God its in a TAG cave among these amazing and exceptional human beings.\n\nA special shout out to my friends involved in this rescue. Thanks for everything. Hope to cave with you guys again soon: Andy Zellner, Kyle Gochenour, Mark and Shannon Whitmer, Michael Hopkins, the Lane Family (Buddy, Doranne, Micha), Will Urbanski, Marty Abercrombie, Allen Padgett, Tim White, Lane Outz, Brad Tipton who am I forgetting? A lot of you.

It's great to get our eyes on a candidate we like, and we really appreciate the attention to design cues, engineering detail, and scheduling.\n\nWe're currently working with contractors and architects on potential modifications to the space that might affect the tree dimensions — mainly exploring the possibility of raising the ceiling/roof in the areas with the main stage and the spot where the tree will be installed. I'll let you know when that decision lands, but ideally it means another 5–6 feet of vertical clearance.\n\nAdditionally, the current tenants have asked for an extension on their occupancy, which gives us more time to design and plan without incurring fixed costs before opening. Hoping that gives us additional runway to nail down details.\n\nOn to the tree:\n\nFrom the renderings, Design 1 nailed the size and proportions we were aiming for. It had a higher average trunk diameter that really helps the tree stand out in the space. If we do go higher with the ceiling, would it be feasible to scale both the height and the trunk diameter up a bit?\n\nIn Design 2, we loved how the branch and root structures spread out more proportionally to the trunk. It adds a lot of character to the silhouette. We also liked the angles in both designs where the structure is a bit off-kilter or irregular rather than straight. Instead of simply widening the branch structure of Design 1, would it be possible to incorporate some of the smaller-diameter branch elements from Design 2 into Design 1 — essentially combining the branching characteristics of the two to create more spread?\n\nWe also talked about the density and depth of the LED channeling. The vision is to have around 10–12 strands running up the circumference of the trunk on average, though I may need to manage my own expectations there. The deep channeling creates a great diffused look, but we'd also like to experiment (in addition to what's rendered) with adding some shallower channels, and even another layer of lights obscured behind vines or vein-like detail. I'm hoping a variety of depths and diffusion styles will create some interesting opportunities for lighting, animation, and production design. For lights closer to the surface, I found some smaller controllable LED options that could provide a subtle twinkle effect, even if exposed in some spots.\n\nLastly, speaking of vines and finer detail — we were curious what adding more surface detail would require, or whether we're constrained by time or materials. The RFP wasn't meant to be limiting in that regard. I was definitely inspired by the creeping, amorphic detail in some of your sculptures, and I was hoping the tree would adopt some of that character. I also want to make sure it's something you'd be proud to put your name on. If the fine surface detail (channels, vines, veins, texture) can't coexist with the industrial look we need, I'd prefer to defer to your artistic judgment on achieving the most characteristic finish. And apologies if I'm jumping ahead — I know you mentioned this phase is more about shape and presence.\n\nI realize almost everything I've mentioned represents additional time and expense. Fortunately, there's flexibility in the budget to explore, and with the extension we now have more runway in the project timeline to make the biggest statement we can.\n\nLet me know what you think, and thanks again for all your work.\n\nVery respectfully,\nRyan"}], "metadata": {"path": "emails/outbound/2021-12-16_tree_feedback.json", "source": "email", "date": "2021-12-16", "id": null, "title": null, "topic": null, "topics": ["creative collaboration", "design feedback", "art direction", "technical communication", "relationship management", "vision alignment"], "tone": ["collaborative", "enthusiastic", "diplomatic", "technical-artistic hybrid", "supportive"], "channel": null}}

Geographically, the rough deployment order would be: central US, eastern US, western US, central EU, central/south America, and finally Asia Pacific.\n\nWhile we could build out a rack with just power and cross-connect access, if there's an opportunity to leverage existing network, firewall, or IPMI infrastructure, that would definitely be of interest.

It didn't take long to realize @dr.djr_ wasn't the “change your relationship status” kind of special, as much as the “change your outlook on life” kind of special. In the whirlwind since, we've traveled, explored, adventured and have grown together more than I'd ever dreamed possible… a journey that representing in just ten photos proved exceptionally hard.\n\nScrolling through again, every image feels like more than just a snapshot of a place; but like chapters of a story. And more than anything, it's a story that's taught me that the most precious moments are those shared with someone who understands not just who you are, but who you have the potential to be. Someone who sees beauty in your flaws and strength in your vulnerabilities. Someone who makes every day an adventure, whether we're crossing time zones or just crossing the street.\n\nI'm finally mashing the share button now to correct a glaring omission to this feed, and dispense gratitude for the adventures I've had with the people (and particular person) who've made them unforgettable. To all of us who've been long connected, know that the greatest stories are sometimes those we live offline, becoming our most authentic selves, in the company of those who we love the most. And while I weigh the prospect of posting more on the gram and catching up on these last formative years, I can't argue against the idea of taking a break, stepping back, and discovering/cherishing the things that truly bring us joy.\n\nTo quote one of my favorite authors: It's been a journey of discovery, love, and the kind of growth that only comes when you're willing to lose sight of the shore.\n\nGrateful for every single friend who's been a part of my/our journey… in any capacity.

Around the same time I started dipping my toes into social waters as a young adult. The attention was unlike anything I'd ever experienced and felt like validation in overdrive, probably magnified by a relatively sheltered childhood. That era definitely registers as a time I felt most alive.\n\nIn my early thirties, still relatively new to dating, I went to Buenos Aires to visit a guy I had met in Atlanta who had moved there for work. The weeks I spent there weren't just an opportunity to spend time with him, but to figure out how to live life again in a new place: overcoming language barriers, navigating tiendas instead of big box stores, figuring out cooking, social cadence, all of it. I grew up outside the United States, so maybe the difference or 'alienness' is what felt familiar.\n\nMore recently, my partner and I were at a festival in D.C. while we were also house hunting and putting in offers back in Atlanta. In the middle of a crowd and a set, we signed and submitted an offer on a place we'd been considering, while simultaneously asking ourselves, 'Is this remotely appropriate?' Looking back, it's hilarious—a more extreme version of adding stuff to an Amazon cart drunk in the middle of the night.\n\nA weirdly happy and intense moment for me was in July 2019 when Microsoft announced Flight Simulator 2020. I credit the franchise for sparking my interest in aviation, sending me to my college flying club, and driving me to get my pilot's license. I declared computer science as a second major to civil engineering with this secret hope of getting a job with ACES Studio and the Flight Simulator team. When they shuttered the studio and shelved the title around the time I was graduating, it was a big disappointment for me and an entire ecosystem of simmers and aviation nerds. I admired the community for modding and keeping it alive, and I lamented the loss of the oldest franchise in software. When Asobo and Microsoft surprise-announced a new Flight Simulator after a decade, with the promise of making it truly special again, and I saw it from my then-job at Boeing, I pretty much wept with joy.

Eventually I reframed it as, ‘the fleet management system is accruing massive technical debt and risk because of these high-level decisions.'
