Last week I finally eclipsed the 80 lb mark. Eighty pounds ago I was unhealthy, depressed and relentlessly tired/stressed. While the journey isn't over, this was one moment I planned on letting gratitude (and yeah definitely some #vanity) get the best of me. In the end there are infinitely more valuable ways to invest in your person (intelligence, personality, experience, relationships, adventure, etc) but there's also nothing better than feeling healthy and being comfortable in your own skin.

It didn't take long to realize @dr.djr_ wasn't the “change your relationship status” kind of special, as much as the “change your outlook on life” kind of special. In the whirlwind since, we've traveled, explored, adventured and have grown together more than I'd ever dreamed possible… a journey that representing in just ten photos proved exceptionally hard.\n\nScrolling through again, every image feels like more than just a snapshot of a place; but like chapters of a story. And more than anything, it's a story that's taught me that the most precious moments are those shared with someone who understands not just who you are, but who you have the potential to be. Someone who sees beauty in your flaws and strength in your vulnerabilities. Someone who makes every day an adventure, whether we're crossing time zones or just crossing the street.\n\nI'm finally mashing the share button now to correct a glaring omission to this feed, and dispense gratitude for the adventures I've had with the people (and particular person) who've made them unforgettable. To all of us who've been long connected, know that the greatest stories are sometimes those we live offline, becoming our most authentic selves, in the company of those who we love the most. And while I weigh the prospect of posting more on the gram and catching up on these last formative years, I can't argue against the idea of taking a break, stepping back, and discovering/cherishing the things that truly bring us joy.\n\nTo quote one of my favorite authors: It's been a journey of discovery, love, and the kind of growth that only comes when you're willing to lose sight of the shore.\n\nGrateful for every single friend who's been a part of my/our journey… in any capacity. Cheers to the adventures that await.\n\n<3 #bf"

An idea that existed in drawing, renderings, requirements, models and emails - born from hundreds of hands and minds, from late nights and early mornings, from the kind of stubborn optimism that only aviation seems to inspire.\n\nBut now it's in our hangar, making final preparations for first flight. I am beyond blessed for the opportunity to be part of this team of aviators and nerds who work on the bleeding edge of aerospace.\n\nAnyway … more to come. Especially when this thing takes to the skies in the coming weeks! 🚀\n\n#Wisk #eVTOL #Gen6 #FutureOfFlight #BuiltNotRendered #HardWorkWorks"
