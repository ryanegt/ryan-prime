    "content": "Hey Quinton and Brent,\n\nHappy new year — I hope you both had a restful break and were able to recharge.\n\nOver the last few months, and especially over the holidays, one of my long-standing projects moved from concept to prototype and then received funding. It's an embedded platform for event production and venues, and it's going to require my full attention over the next year.\n\nGiven that my availability and performance have already been spotty due to prior commitments, I hope you agree that stepping back from my role with the project is the best move for all of us. I genuinely wish the absolute best for the work ahead, and I hope the victories and accomplishments we shared outweighed the drudgery and frustration along the way. I'm proud of what we accomplished and grateful for the opportunity to have been part of it.\n\nWith the new help onboard, I think the technology is in great hands. I'm still available for some hourly contracting and consulting to make sure things have the best possible outcome, but over the next 2–4 weeks I’ll need to wind down my role in the project as a whole.\n\nOf course, I’m only sharing this with the two of you. This should have been an in-person conversation rather than an email, so apologies for that. Let me know when you'd like to set up some time to talk.\n\nGratefully, respectfully,\nRyan",
