    "content": "Hey Jordan,\n\nWe've finally had a chance to review and discuss the renderings. It's great to get our eyes on a candidate we like, and we really appreciate the attention to design cues, engineering detail, and scheduling.\n\nWe're currently working with contractors and architects on potential modifications to the space that might affect the tree dimensions — mainly exploring the possibility of raising the ceiling/roof in the areas with the main stage and the spot where the tree will be installed. I'll let you know when that decision lands, but ideally it means another 5–6 feet of vertical clearance.\n\nAdditionally, the current tenants have asked for an extension on their occupancy, which gives us more time to design and plan without incurring fixed costs before opening. Hoping that gives us additional runway to nail down details.\n\nOn to the tree:\n\nFrom the renderings, Design 1 nailed the size and proportions we were aiming for. It had a higher average trunk diameter that really helps the tree stand out in the space. If we do go higher with the ceiling, would it be feasible to scale both the height and the trunk diameter up a bit?\n\nIn Design 2, we loved how the branch and root structures spread out more proportionally to the trunk. It adds a lot of character to the silhouette. We also liked the angles in both designs where the structure is a bit off-kilter or irregular rather than straight. Instead of simply widening the branch structure of Design 1, would it be possible to incorporate some of the smaller-diameter branch elements from Design 2 into Design 1 — essentially combining the branching characteristics of the two to create more spread?\n\nWe also talked about the density and depth of the LED channeling. The vision is to have around 10–12 strands running up the circumference of the trunk on average, though I may need to manage my own expectations there. The deep channeling creates a great diffused look, but we'd also like to experiment (in addition to what's rendered) with adding some shallower channels, and even another layer of lights obscured behind vines or vein-like detail. I'm hoping a variety of depths and diffusion styles will create some interesting opportunities for lighting, animation, and production design. For lights closer to the surface, I found some smaller controllable LED options that could provide a subtle twinkle effect, even if exposed in some spots.\n\nLastly, speaking of vines and finer detail — we were curious what adding more surface detail would require, or whether we're constrained by time or materials. The RFP wasn't meant to be limiting in that regard. I was definitely inspired by the creeping, amorphic detail in some of your sculptures, and I was hoping the tree would adopt some of that character. I also want to make sure it's something you'd be proud to put your name on. If the fine surface detail (channels, vines, veins, texture) can't coexist with the industrial look we need, I'd prefer to defer to your artistic judgment on achieving the most characteristic finish. And apologies if I'm jumping ahead — I know you mentioned this phase is more about shape and presence.\n\nI realize almost everything I've mentioned represents additional time and expense. Fortunately, there's flexibility in the budget to explore, and with the extension we now have more runway in the project timeline to make the biggest statement we can.\n\nLet me know what you think, and thanks again for all your work.\n\nVery respectfully,\nRyan",
