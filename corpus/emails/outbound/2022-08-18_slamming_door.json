I'm going to look into insulated stripping and a closing arm this weekend to keep it from slamming. If there's additional noise coming from traffic or our unit downstairs, we'll keep identifying soundproofing options as well.\n\nThanks for reaching out and keeping it between the units — happy to work with you to be better neighbors. :)\n\nBest,\nRyan",
