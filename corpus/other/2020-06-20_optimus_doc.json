Pilots must also receive 10 hours of rest in the last 24 hours, limiting total duty time to roughly 14 hours. A fixed number of aircraft and pilots are available; each originates from different nodes. Unless overnighting cost is included, aircraft must return to originating nodes. If overnighting is allowed, pilots cannot exceed three consecutive overnights. Aircraft utilization is also constrained by maintenance timers. If a pilot exceeded limits on a prior assignment, compensatory rest must be accounted for. Locked schedules created by humans must also be respected.",

Schedule building proceeds by selecting the lowest-cost dead leg, eliminating pairings involving satisfied flights, selecting the nearest available aircraft, and checking flight and duty legality. If legal, the pairing is added; if not, a new schedule is created. This repeats until all flights are paired.
