      "text": "I haven't filed a tax return since 2022. There's shame, embarrassment, and a sense of failure wrapped up in it, fueled by my ability to procrastinate when there's no immediate negative feedback. My partner is very financially responsible and I haven't told him, partly because it's not something I'm proud of and partly because I usually get refunds rather than owing. Intellectually it doesn't feel financially destructive, but I know if I wait too long I'll start forfeiting refunds. The startup energy to do three years of returns feels immense, so I keep pushing it off, and that creates a low-level, persistent anxiety that lives under the surface of my behavior. I don't think I'd lie if directly asked, but it's a shame of omission that I'm very aware of."

That's where I've seen the most destructive patterns. I advise people to understand what they're putting in their body, what the effects and side effects are, what the risks are, and what makes the experience more responsible and fulfilling.

Maybe that's because being on the receiving end of that kind of behind-the-back character assassination was a specific brand of torture for me growing up. Even if I have a poor opinion of someone, I generally won't sit around and talk badly about them in private, and if a conversation is going that way I won't want to be present for it."

Even though those decisions were way above my official senior software engineer pay grade, I was confident that my ten years of prior CTO experience at an air taxi operator correctly informed my point of view. I raised concerns in 1-1s with my manager and their manager, and they acknowledged me but never escalated or gave meaningful feedback—mostly because I don't think they fully understood the context. Eventually I reframed it as, ‘the fleet management system is accruing massive technical debt and risk because of these high-level decisions.' That didn't trigger some grand strategic pivot, but it did put me in charge of our fleet management and operational software decisions. Later, I scheduled time with the CFO for a friendly conversation about my experience and where I thought we could do better. I never felt fully taken seriously, but now that high-level strategy has shifted closer to what I was arguing, I feel somewhat vindicated. A small part of me wishes that credit had been passed down."

When it does happen—when I'm personally or professionally wrong—my first internal reaction is usually a mix of crush and shame. Outwardly I try to project surprise or thoughtfulness, whatever feels disarming and appropriate in the moment. That usually evolves into a blend of humor and humility. I'll repeat the realization out loud to make it a learning moment for myself and explicitly give the other person credit for being right. Everyone makes mistakes; I don't hold others in contempt for being wrong, and I try not to hold myself there either."

I'm happy doing my own thing and appreciate that he has a lot of his own thing going on too. I think he had more emotional support anchors growing up, whereas I learned to grow without making deep connections. As I got older I did get pretty depressed about the idea that I might die alone—because I don't think even the most recluse person truly wants to be completely alone. Now when Dakota is especially velcro-ey, I can feel stuffy and sometimes long for isolation, but I wouldn't dream of going back to the time before we met. On the flip side, on the rare occasions where he wants more independence than I do, my brain jumps to the story that he's lost interest—that he finally wised up and realized there are way better options out there. It's never actually been the case; it's just my self-deprecating tendencies talking."
