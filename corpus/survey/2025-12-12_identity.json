      "text": "As a kid in Iceland, I actually grew up on a Naval Air Station, so planes were circling all the time. The afterburners of practicing fighter jets were often my alarm to wake up for school, haha. We would see air shows and the walk up to the Blue Angels, but my favorite planes were actually the big cargo carriers. We flew often back to the states to visit family, in many kinds of civilian and military aircraft. Around my 16th birthday, my parents bought me a discovery flight where I got to go up with a pilot in a 152. Any thought I had about pursing flight school or becoming a pilot though was tamed by the fact that we were pretty poor and I assumed my parents couldn't pay for flight school. So once I was in college and making enough money, I began my own training."

Dad-joke style that always earns me a dead stare. Self deprecation is pretty much my identity. Often people will refer to me or introduce me as someone who is smart, but I quickly correct or follow with “just a nerd really.” It may belie my position and experience but I think intelligence is so subjective. One thing I try never to do is punch down. Especially in a racial sense or against qualities outside of peoples control.

It feels like magic, something that shouldn't be possible. Leonardo Davinci's “Once you have tasted flight…” quote, and John Magee's “slipped the surly bonds of Earth…” poem I think capture the non-obvious part better than I ever could.
